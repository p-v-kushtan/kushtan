But in our time of digital technologies and pandemics, places of art are changing and becoming more accessible. Museums such as MET, Louvre, Guggenheim have opened their doors to all people of the world, making it possible to visit their galleries online using VR technologies.</p><p class="article__text">The artist's space is also undergoing changes: and if the physical-tangible space used to be a platform for creativity, now the online space is also becoming one. Yes, you can't smell the paint in it, but you can be with art tête-à-tête.</p><p class="article__text">Thus, the online space becomes a platform for the artist, where it is possible to create and realize their art.</p><p class="article__text">And I had the opportunity to realize such a space.</p><h3 class="article__subtitle">Understanding the user</h3><h4 class="article__subtitling">Project challenge:</h4><p class="article__text">I needed to create a design that would simultaneously meet the requirements of the artist and their target audience. It was necessary to create a solution that would become both a space of creation and a direct exhibition hall. It will have to reflect the creativity of the project and at the same time have already intuitive familiar elements of web design.</p><p class="article__text">To begin with, I needed to conduct research, determine the target audience and make a statement of the problem and the goal of the project.</p><p class="article__text">After conducting an interview and analyzing the data, I identified the main target audience groups:</p><ul class="article__list"><li class="article__item">art lovers</li><li class="article__item">art-galleries bookers</li><li class="article__item">designers and people who need paintings for commercial and personal purposes</li></ul><h4 class="article__subtitling">Pain points:</h4><ul class="article__list"><li class="article__item">The artist's creative space is usually closed to the eyes of most people</li><li class="article__item">It's hard to find conceptual artists</li><li class="article__item">Authentic authors are often only available in galleries and private exhibitions</li></ul><div class="article__box"><h4 class="article__subtitling">Goal statement:</h4><p class="article__text">The digital art space will be able to help users gain access to conceptual art and the artist's works, which will allow them to enjoy art from anywhere, get acquainted with the author and order their works.</p></div><h3 class="article__subtitle">Starting the design</h3><p class="article__text">To begin with, I needed to determine the main user path, so I created a user flow and sitemap, based on which I made sketches of the main pages and their functionality.</p><p class="article__text">I have divided the main areas of the author's work into sections:</p><ul class="article__list"><li class="article__item">The basic collection of paintings</li><li class="article__item">Prose and poetry</li><li class="article__item">Conceptual projects</li></ul><p class="article__text">(As the content scales, it will be possible to divide the main collection into subsections, but so far this has not been necessary.)</p><p class="article__text">By adding the homepage and contact pages, I built the client's main path and the site map, based on them I made the first sketches:</p><p class="article__text">the homepage included a greeting from the author and a picture of one of the works, after which the user could start his discover –> from the main page he gets to the main gallery, where he can immediately get acquainted with the works of the author—> by clicking on the picture, the user can immediately view it from various angles, see the characteristics and read what inspired the author's right to create a work. If a client wants to purchase a work, then by clicking button 'get' goes to the author's contact page.</p><picture class="article__image"><source srcset="img/works/work-07/sitemap.png" media="(min-width: 760px)" alt="sitemap"><img src="img/works/work-07/sitemap.png" style="width:100%" alt="sitemap"></picture><h4 class="article__subtitling">Wireframing</h4><p class="article__text">After ideation and paper wireframes I created low-fidelity prototype.</p><p class="article__text">The main structure for layout: splitting the screen interface in half. In the mobile version – horizontally, in the desktop version – vertically. This will give a lot of negative space and air, will allow to make accents and also it adds creative impression.</p><picture class="article__image"><source srcset="img/works/work-07/wireframes.png" media="(min-width: 760px)" alt="wireframes"><img src="img/works/work-07/wireframes.png" style="width:100%" alt="wireframes"></picture><strong class="article__text" style="font-weight: 500;">After conducting the usability study, I made a refining based on the findings:</strong><ol class="article__list"><li class="article__item">The user is more comfortable when there is additional navigation in the footer (the artist was categorically against footers (why?because) but I managed to convince him of his need);</li><li class="article__item">Hide the characteristics of the pictures: in the mobile version, they make the interface heavy.</li></ol><strong class="article__text" style="font-weight: 500;">Also I created:</strong><ul class="article__list"><li class="article__item">pages for projects that are still in the process of creation</li><li class="article__item">plugs</li><li class="article__item">404 page</li></ul><h4 class="article__subtitling">Adding creative element:</h4><p class="article__text">I wanted to add something distinctive to the design that would create a sense of the presence of the author and the atmosphere of the workshop in the work. So I added an element to the header – the artist's current mood, where they can share their current thoughts and moods with the audience. (This element will be on every page – 'of course, it's in the header').</p><picture class="article__image"><source srcset="img/works/work-07/01-large.png" media="(min-width: 760px)" alt="element preview"><img src="img/works/work-07/01-small.png" style="width:100%" alt="element preview"></picture><h3 class="article__subtitle">UI, Prototying and building</h3><p class="article__text">Based on lo-fi, I started to develop the design concept of the project. I needed to take photos of the artist's paintings and prepare photo and text content for the product. Working with the text involved creating the voice of the product: in this case, it was friendly and philosophical.</p><picture class="article__image"><source srcset="img/works/work-07/02.png" media="(min-width: 760px)" alt="website page with brand voice text"><img src="img/works/work-07/02.png" style="width:100%" alt="website page with brand voice text"></picture><h4 class="article__subtitling">The colors:</h4><p class="article__text">Definitely, the focus should be on the author's work, so I took only black and white palette.</p><h4 class="article__subtitling">The typography:</h4><p class="article__text">For typography, I chose Miriam Libre for text and Headland One for headlines – they combine perfectly and create the impression of a single font, despite the different families. MiriamLibre sans serif is perfectly readable in texts, and headland one looks clean and expensive in headlines with medium and large size.</p><h4 class="article__subtitling">Functional elements and states:</h4><p class="article__text">For buttons and links, I made a simple design with underlining and changing background and font colors.</p><picture class="article__image"><source srcset="img/works/work-07/kit.png" media="(min-width: 760px)" alt="ui kit"><img src="img/works/work-07/kit.png" style="width:100%" alt="ui kit"></picture><h4 class="article__subtitling">High-fidelity prototype</h4><p class="article__text">The final prototype includes refining based on usability study.</p><a class="article__text" href="https://www.figma.com/proto/Jg6bZxUzTs61p7wluO394U/ditto?page-id=612%3A1757&amp;node-id=612%3A657&amp;viewport=2650%2C638%2C0.65&amp;scaling=scale-down-width&amp;starting-point-node-id=612%3A657" style="font-weight: 500;
