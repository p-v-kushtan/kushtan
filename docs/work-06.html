The main tasks included:</p><ul class="article__list"><li class="article__item">Create a product with own brand identity</li><li class="article__item">Form and structure existing services and implement new ones</li><li class="article__item">To make a focus on the wedding services</li></ul><h3 class="article__subtitle">How to choose a stylist for a wedding (or other important event)?</h3><p class="article__text">Before I started anything, I decided to conduct research on this issue, because I had the task here - to create a product for the end-user who has this problem.</p><p class="article__text">After conducting interviews with five women aged 23 to 32, I identified several clear positions that influence a person's choice in this situation:</p><ul class="article__list"><li class="article__item">Specialist with home visits service;</li><li class="article__item">Who has an event support service;</li><li class="article__item">The specialist is pleasant to communicate with;</li><li class="article__item">A portfolio that matches own taste and style preferences;</li><li class="article__item">Comfortable price;</li><li class="article__item">It is preferable that the person has a confirmed qualification;</li><li class="article__item">А specialist is advised by friends or he has positive reviews about the work.</li></ul><p class="article__text">The interviewees shared the problems associated with such searches: despite a fairly wide offer of specialists, it is difficult to find a person who meets all the factors.</p><ul class="article__list"><li class="article__item">High price</li><li class="article__item">Mismatch to taste</li><li class="article__item">There are no reviews and qualifications</li><li class="article__item">Unpleasant in communication</li><li class="article__item">Has no support for the wedding or other event</li></ul><h3 class="article__subtitle">Where are people looking for a specialist?</h3><p class="article__text">During the interview, I also asked people where they usually look for stylists:</p><ul class="article__list"><li class="article__item">Search engines (Google, Yandex)</li><li class="article__item">Social networks: instagram, facebook, vk</li><li class="article__item">Acquaintances of friends and family</li><li class="article__item">Special resources for finding specialists: profi.ru, avito</li></ul><p class="article__text">Despite these possibilities, there are one point  in the search process: some people don’t have a profile on socials and thus they are deprived of access to the database of specialists.</p><h3 class="article__subtitle">Why do people keep looking for stylists and using their services?</h3><p class="article__text">During my research, I was able to identify the following reasons:</p><strong class="article__text" style="font-weight: 500;">Tradition:</strong><p class="article__text">The wedding stylist has become an integral part of the pre-wedding preparation in the culture of people.</p><strong class="article__text" style="font-weight: 500;">Feeling of happiness and self-satisfaction:</strong><p class="article__text">People want to look special on special days, which is possible to achieve with the help of professional skills</p><strong class="article__text" style="font-weight: 500;">Delegating tasks and feeling calm:</strong><p class="article__text">It is more comfortable and calmer for people on important days to provide a solution to the problem of visual appearance to a specialist</p><h3 class="article__subtitle">What are the essentials?</h3><p class="article__text">Next, I created an empathy map that helped identify the pain points and gains of the target audience and defined a problem statement.</p><picture class="article__image"><source srcset="img/works/work-06/empathy-map.png" media="(min-width: 760px)" alt="empathy map"><img src="img/works/work-06/empathy-map.png" style="width:100%" alt="empathy map"></picture><picture class="article__image"><source srcset="img/works/work-06/pains.png" media="(min-width: 760px)" alt="pains and gains spreadsheet"><img src="img/works/work-06/pains.png" style="width:100%" alt="pains and gains spreadsheet"></picture><div class="article__box"><strong class="article__text" style="font-weight: 500;">Problem statement:</strong><p class="article__text">How can we create a website for a stylist so as to introduce the audience to the master in absentia, show the level of proficiency in the specialty, eliminate fear and distrust and provide an easy way to communicate?</p></div><h3 class="article__subtitle">Finding solutions for identified pain points</h3><p class="article__text">Keeping all this in mind, I began to think about solutions to user pains:</p><strong class="article__text" style="font-weight: 500;">“Expensive”</strong><p class="article__text">From the interview, it became clear to me that some clients are ready to implement beauty work for themselves on their own but do not have the skills. To do this, I can introduce a special training service master class for such people at a comfortable market price. Also, additionally introduce the possibility of ordering gift certificates, which will make it possible to pay for services by friends and family.</p><strong class="article__text" style="font-weight: 500;">“It's hard to find a specialist and entrust him to lead such an important event”</strong><p class="article__text">Trust: it is necessary to create a conversation between the client and the stylist, tell the story of the formation of the master, form an individual friendly voice that will openly tell and guide the client throughout the entire experience. Tool: Text content.</p><p class="article__text">Search: it will be necessary to build the site efficiently, add all the necessary settings for seo and add all the social networks of the stylist to the site.</p><strong class="article__text" style="font-weight: 500;">“People lie about their qualifications and experience”</strong><p class="article__text">People tend to trust someone they know about. So I decided that I would need to create a “message” on the about page from the master to clients, in which the master will tell about his path in the beauty field, about his desires and aspirations in work. A kind of cover letter. After that, I will need to insert sections with a list of master certificates and several reviews + be sure to insert a link to the resource confirming the information.</p><strong class="article__text" style="font-weight: 500;">“The price often does not match the quality”</strong><p class="article__text">The correspondence of price and quality is often determined by the number of positive reviews and ratings, since both price and quality categories are relative. This problem can also be solved by the section with customer reviews of the stylist.</p><strong class="article__text" style="font-weight: 500;">“Sometimes the stylist and the client have a different sense and understanding of style”</strong><p class="article__text">It is necessary to make it clear to the user in what style the stylist works. To do this, I’ll need to insert a sufficient number of photos of the master's works in each category to form a correct idea of the style.</p><strong class="article__text" style="font-weight: 500;">“No wedding support service”</strong><p class="article__text">To introduce a wedding support service on request with clear conditions.</p><h3 class="article__subtitle">What features can add more value to the solutions?</h3><p class="article__text">I took the identified audience gains and started thinking about how to implement them in the solutions.</p><strong class="article__text" style="font-weight: 500;">“Find a specialist with a comfortable price corresponding to the quality”</strong><p class="article__text">To make a person feel comfortable, you need to enter several possible price choices + add section with reviews to confirm the quality of services;</p><strong class="article__text" style="font-weight: 500;">"Find a person I can trust"</strong><p class="article__text">The feeling of trust must be recreated in the conditions of correspondence acquaintance. This can be achieved by creating the illusion of a conversation between the master and the client with the help of a logical structured text content and elements leading the user around the site. I also need to add the definitions of trust and sincerity to the brand positioning;</p><strong class="article__text" style="font-weight: 500;">“The specialist's taste in style matches mine”</strong><p class="article__text">In order for the user to immediately understand the style and genre of the author's works, it is necessary to create several galleries of works from the portfolio that best reflect the direction;</p><strong class="article__text" style="font-weight: 500;">“Direct contact with the stylist”</strong><p class="article__text">For the convenience of customers, it will be good to add buttons for direct contact with the stylist. For example, via telegram;</p><strong class="article__text" style="font-weight: 500;">“Quickly find a specialist without using social networks”</strong><p class="article__text">The master's website should be in the first position in the search (make corrections in the text and other SEO settings) + add the site to the maps engines.</p><h3 class="article__subtitle">Setting priorities</h3><p class="article__text">With all this information, I began to think about forming all the solutions into one. To structure the information and highlight the essence, I decided to use the Moscow method.</p><picture class="article__image"><source srcset="img/works/work-06/moscow.png" media="(min-width: 760px)" alt="moscow matrix table"><img src="img/works/work-06/moscow.png" style="width:100%" alt="moscow matrix table"></picture><p class="article__text">I was interested in creating a website solution where a person gets to know the author in absentia, learns about his works, experience, opinions and will be able to find the optimal service for himself with the simplest possible way to communicate with the master, which will exclude forms as a way of recording and communication (see the won't have section).</p><h3 class="article__subtitle">Defining user flow and creating a sitemap</h3><p class="article__text">At this step, I created a user flow to determine the basic skeleton of the future site.</p><picture class="article__image"><source srcset="img/works/work-06/userflow.png" media="(min-width: 760px)" alt="userflow"><img src="img/works/work-06/userflow.png" style="width:100%" alt="userflow"></picture><p class="article__text">Then, based on the flow, I created a site map, keeping in mind the main solutions and functions that should be synthesized on the site. I distributed the functions across the pages, after which I built the main structure, adhering to a clear and logical information hierarchy.</p><picture class="article__image"><source srcset="img/works/work-06/sitemap.png" media="(min-width: 760px)" alt="sitemap"><img src="img/works/work-06/sitemap.png" style="width:100%" alt="sitemap"></picture><h3 class="article__subtitle">Sketching</h3><p class="article__text">After the main pages and the functionality of each have been defined, it's time to understand the best options for placing elements on screens.</p><p class="article__text">I started with wireframes to determine if there is any sense in the flow and whether they solve the main user's request: to see the author's work, qualifications, reviews, terms of cooperation and contact him to order the service.</p><picture class="article__image"><source srcset="img/works/work-06/lofi-large.png" media="(min-width: 760px)" alt="low-fidelity screens"><img src="img/works/work-06/lofi-small.png" style="width:100%" alt="low-fidelity screens"></picture><p class="article__text">Then I decided already at this step to create a brand voice as close as possible to the final version using the text content. The main goal for me here was to create a conversation between the client and the stylist, simulating live communication. I achieved this with the help of a friendly and open tone with elements of the narrative genre. </p><h3 class="article__subtitle">Testing prototype</h3><p class="article__text">Next, I showed the prototype to three people who did not participate in the interview and conducted a usability study with the following instructions:</p><ul class="article__list"><li class="article__item">Find information about stylist</li><li class="article__item">Find reviews and qualifications;</li><li class="article__item">Find a wedding image service;</li><li class="article__item">Find a way to communicate with the master directly.</li></ul><p class="article__text">Percentage of completing the path and completing tasks: 100%. I also received a useful feedback on the moment of the gift certificates section:</p><div class="article__box"><p class="article__text">since a person orders a gift card as a gift, they will want to see how it will look.</p></div><p class="article__text">With this conclusion, I decided to implement a gallery with a view of certificates in this section.</p><h3 class="article__subtitle">Refining and creating hi-fi prototype</h3><p class="article__text">I implemented the necessary changes and, once satisfied with the result, started creating screens for the hi-fi prototype. In the process, I used the mobile first method with creating the responsiveness for different versions of devices.</p><p class="article__text">Since there were no requirements for colors and typography, I decided to analyze the target audience by psychotype and choose the right colors.</p><div class="article__box"><strong class="article__text" style="font-weight: 500;">Color:</strong><p class="article__text">Since clients who are in search of a wedding stylist are often already in a state of stress (= excitement), bright shades were banned. We needed a soothing and neutral palette of colors, which also would not distract attention from the photo content with the master's works. So I came to the choice of an accent color of brown tone in addition to the standard black and white colors.</p><strong class="article__text" style="font-weight: 500;">Typography:</strong><p class="article__text">To choose the typography, I was guided by the classical style of wedding invitations to evoke the right associations - the choice fell on the Serif family with serifs, and visual pure aesthetics, as well as support for Cyrillic and Latin characters.</p></div><p class="article__text">The idea of a clean and simple UI meets the goal of focusing users' attention on the author's works and portfolio, as well as the task of not overloading the pages with unnecessary accents.</p><picture class="article__image"><source srcset="img/works/work-06/hifi-large.png" media="(min-width: 760px)" alt="high-fidelity screens"><img src="img/works/work-06/hifi-small.png" style="width:100%" alt="high-fidelity screens"></picture><a class="article__text" href="https://www.figma.com/proto/YyJEKJZeYi0FrfJy2V57G1/website-for-a-stylist?page-id=322%3A1251&amp;node-id=321%3A4&amp;viewport=471%2C385%2C0.09&amp;scaling=min-zoom&amp;starting-point-node-id=321%3A4" style="font-weight: 500; text-decoration: underline; color: black;">Watch prototype in Figma</a><p class="article__text">I created prototypes for the desktop and mobile versions of the site, clearly building a design system of fonts, colors and grids.</p><h3 class="article__subtitle">Graphics</h3><p class="article__text">After creating the design system and defining the UI, I started creating mockups for gift cards for each service in two languages and certificates of completion of the stylist’s courses for users.</p><p class="article__text">All of them are created according to a common design system and support the overall friendly tone of the brand.</p><picture class="article__image"><source srcset="img/works/work-06/gift-large.png" media="(min-width: 760px)" alt="gift card sample"><img src="img/works/work-06/gift-small.png" style="width:100%" alt="gift card sample"></picture><p class="article__text">It is these certificates that will be inserted into the relevant section for the preview, which was revealed as a result of the first testing.</p><h3 class="article__subtitle">Developing, testing and launch</h3><p class="article__text">After showing the prototype to the client and approving the design, I started building the site using the constructor. Why the constructor and not the code: the client requested a resource that will give control over the website after the project is launched.</p><p class="article__text">So I started building a website based on a prototype, paying attention to the moments for good seo such as headings, alts and others.</p><p class="article__text">When the main pages and responsiveness were created and tested, I created a second version of the site in a foreign language (this was in the brief).</p><p class="article__text">Further actions included technical tasks such as connecting a domain, getting the site ready for seo, adding the website to Google console and Yandex.metric, adding the company on Google and Yandex maps with the service descriptions creation.</p><h3 class="article__subtitle">After all, has the product solved the users' pain?</h3><p class="article__text">To find out, we’ll need to conduct another usability testing. I believe that the creation of openness in the master-client relationship, which was implemented in the tone of the brand throughout the site and the availability of communication, will create a positive trend in cooperation between both sides.</p><p class="article__text">Looking back at my notes after the interview in the section "how to choose a stylist", I can say with confidence that it was possible to find a solution for each problem.</p><strong class="article__text" style="font-weight: 500;">Adding support services and clear terms of cooperation help to find:</strong><ul class="article__list"><li class="article__item">Specialist with home visits service</li><li class="article__item">Who has an event support service</li></ul><strong class="article__text" style="font-weight: 500;">Creating a friendly and open brand tone will make it easier for customers to feel:</strong><ul class="article__list"><li class="article__item">The specialist is pleasant to communicate with</li></ul><strong class="article__text" style="font-weight: 500;">A high-quality portfolio will help the client to understand:</strong><ul class="article__list"><li class="article__item">The stylist's taste and style preferences matches their own</li></ul><strong class="article__text" style="font-weight: 500;">With the introduction of different price options for services, adding gift cards and training courses will become easier for people to find:</strong><ul class="article__list"><li class="article__item">Comfortable price</li></ul><strong class="article__text" style="font-weight: 500;">The reviews section and the certification list will help clients:</strong><ul class="article__list"><li class="article__item">To find a confirmed qualification</li><li class="article__item">To feel the trust</li></ul><h3 class="article__subtitle">Conclusion</h3><p class="article__text">In the end, I believe that the created solution turned out to be interesting. I tried to be as focused on the research results as possible, which allowed me to get a product that meets the needs and desires of both the client and her target audience.</p><p class="article__text">Yes, there are details that can be studied during the next usability studies and implemented as the project scales, but during the process of creating ideas, I tried to be as focused on the research results as possible, which allowed me to get a product that meets the needs and desires of both the client and her target audience.</p><strong class="article__text" style="font-weight: 500;">Thank you!) ⭐</strong><picture class="article__image"><source srcset="img/works/work-06/mockups.png" media="(min-width: 760px)" alt="website preview"><img src="img/works/work-06/mockups.png" style="width:100%" alt="website preview"></picture><a class="article__text" href="https://www.behance.net/gallery/145500597/live-Website-for-a-stylist-and-a-makeup-artist" style="font-style: italic; text-decoration:underline; color: black; margin: 3rem 0;">Watch more on BeHance</a></div></div><button class="scrollToTopBtn" type="button" name="button"><svg width="50" height="48" viewBox="0 0 50 48" fill="white" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M25.0003 44C36.5063 44 45.8337 35.0457 45.8337 24C45.8337 12.9543 36.5063 4 25.0003 4C13.4944 4 4.16699 12.9543 4.16699 24C4.16699 35.0457 13.4944 44 25.0003 44Z" stroke="black" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"></path><path d="M33.3337 24L25.0003 16L16.667 24" stroke="black" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"></path><path d="M25 32V16" stroke="black" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"></path></svg></button></main><div class="footer" id="footer"><div class="footer__wrapper"><div class="footer__element">p.v.kushtan@gmail.com</div><div class="footer__title">the website was designed and developed by myself.</div><div class="footer__socials"><a class="footer__social" href="https://t.me/paulineKushtan"><img class="footer__icon" src="img/index/telegram.svg" alt="telegram"></a><a class="footer__social" href="https://www.behance.net/kushtan"><img class="footer__icon" src="img/index/behance.svg" alt="behance"></a></div></div></div><script src="js/main.js"></script><script src="js/components/scroll.js"></script></body></html>
