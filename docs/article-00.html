Figure/Ground [3/3]</h4><p class="article__text">We have already touched a little on this principle in Multistability. But there we paid attention to the property of perception to alternately see one or another interpretation of the image. (here: either a fork or a bottle of wine.)</p><picture class="article__image"><source srcset="../img/articles/article-00/figure-large.png" media="(min-width: 760px)"><img src="../img/articles/article-00/figure-small.png" style="width:100%;"></picture><strong class="article__text" style="font-weight: 500;">The main idea of the principle: </strong><p class="article__text">perception separates the object from the background. This phenomenon extends to all types of perceived information. Visually we separate the figure of a bird from the background-the sky, audibly we also distinguish one dialogue in a noisy room against the background of many others.</p><div class="article__box"><p class="article__text">For some people with the autistic spectrum of perception, this process happens a little differently. The entire flow of information is analyzed by their brain, without separating the figure from the ground. Therefore, in development it is necessary to take this point into account and not load the interface with information.</p></div><p class="article__text">In design, this principle is fundamental because, unlike works of art, the figure and background have different functions:</p><p class="article__text">figure ‚Äî an element interacting with the user</p><p class="article__text">ground ‚Äî a static frame for the figure</p><p class="article__text">The background should help in the unambiguity of the definition of elements, not distract the user‚Äôs attention from the main elements, but help to focus.</p><em class="article__text" style="font-weight: 500;">If the background is too active, it will begin to compete in perception with the figure and the effect of multistability will begin.</em><p class="article__text">For example, the use of shadows helps to easily separate the shape from the background, which helps perception.</p><picture class="article__image"><source srcset="../img/articles/article-00/figure-2-large.png" media="(min-width: 760px)"><img src="../img/articles/article-00/figure-2-small.png" style="width:100%;"></picture><picture class="article__image"><source srcset="../img/articles/article-00/figure-3-large.png" media="(min-width: 760px)"><img src="../img/articles/article-00/figure-3-small.png" style="width:100%;"></picture><h4 class="article__subtitle">Aaaand‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs it!</h4><p class="article__text">We‚Äôve discussed 4 theoretical theses, 3 basic principles:</p><picture class="article__image"><source srcset="../img/articles/article-00/gestalt-large.png" media="(min-width: 760px)"><img src="../img/articles/article-00/gestalt-small.png" style="width:100%;"></picture><h4 class="article__subtitle">Exercise</h4><p class="article__text">A little training on the principles studied.</p><p class="article__text" style="font-weight: 500;"> What gestalt principles are used in this simple form design?</p><picture class="article__image"><source srcset="../img/articles/article-00/exercise-large.png" media="(min-width: 760px)"><img src="../img/articles/article-00/exercise-small.png" style="width:100%;"></picture><ol class="article__list"><li class="article__item">The principle of the figure/ground: the shape is separated from the background by a shadow;</li><li class="article__item">The principle of grouping ‚Äî common region: the shape is placed in a rectangle and is thus cut off from the rest of the space;</li><li class="article__item">The principle of grouping ‚Äî proximity: the elements are close to each other;</li><li class="article__item">The principle of grouping ‚Äî similarity: inputs in the same style.</li></ol><h4 class="article__subtitle">Conclusion</h4><p class="article__text">This is the end of my immersion in the topic.)
