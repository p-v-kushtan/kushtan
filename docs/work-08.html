We want to sell our works and we want you to develop our webstore. What would you say?</p><p class="article__text">- I'd say it's sounds like you've got an interesting business. And I want to know more about it..</p><h3 class="article__subtitle">Research for the one night</h3><p class="article__text">During the call I could get information for the very basics of usual brief list.</p><strong class="article__text" style="font-weight: 500;">The studio industry:</strong><p class="article__text">Art objects - paintings, busts, sculptures, monuments and custom-made items.</p><strong class="article__text" style="font-weight: 500;">Target audience:</strong><p class="article__text">25+ people who need to buy art for personal or commercial purposes.</p><strong class="article__text" style="font-weight: 500;">Main tasks for the website:</strong><ul class="article__list"><li class="article__item">Tell clients about the studio and their services</li><li class="article__item">Show the products</li><li class="article__item">Create a webstore</li></ul><p class="article__text">We agreed to meet for tomorrow, as the project did not require any delay. And I decided to accept this challenge, especially since I haven't had the joy of going through a ux sprint in the field yet.</p><p class="article__text">I was really glad that I had a day off for that day so I could devote myself completely to research the audience and competitors. I need to dive in the undustry and to fugure out what's going on there.</p><strong class="article__text" style="font-weight: 500;">Secondary and qualitative researches</strong><p class="article__text">I started by surfe the internet on this topic: ordering busts, sculptures, statuettes. I watching stores, forums, social networks groups. After that, I was able to orient myself in this market and identify problems:</p><ul class="article__list"><li class="article__item">Users who wants to purchase art usually pay high price for the qulity and authenticity;</li><li class="article__item">users who can't purchase art at a high price buy in the mass market, where things do not differ in authenticity.</li></ul><p class="article__text">The next step I decided to conduct short online interviews with 5 people (3 men 26, 30 and 53 years old and 2 women 32 and 25 years old) to confirm or refute my conclusions, as well as to find out what is important for them in such tasks.</p><strong class="article__text" style="font-weight: 500;">The questionnaire consisted of:</strong><ul class="article__list"><li class="article__item">Have you ever bought such things as sculptures, paintings, busts or other art?</li><li class="article__item">What was the reason for the purchase? Why do you need such products?</li><li class="article__item">What influenced your choice: price, familiar brand, quality?</li><li class="article__item">What problems/inconveniences did you encounter during the orders?</li><li class="article__item">Are you willing to pay more to make the item unique?</li></ul><strong class="article__text" style="font-weight: 500;">I've got the following conclusions:</strong><ul class="article__list"><li class="article__item">A person buys such products as a gift, either for architectural and design solutions for personal or commercial purposes;</li><li class="article__item">A person is willing to pay more if the thing is unique, but is not willing to overpay;</li><li class="article__item">A person will order products from specialized craftsmen;</li><li class="article__item">It is important for a person to be clear about all the steps of manufacturing products;</li><li class="article__item">A person who has decided to buy such objects expects for an individual approach and support.</li></ul><p class="article__text">On this basis, I was able to create personas and formulate problem statements:</p><div class="article__box"><p class="article__text">Alexander is an interior designer who needs to order art because each interior requires an individual design, and art on sale usually do not meet the requirements.</p><p class="article__text">Maria is a teacher and a mother who wants to buy inexpensive art objects as a gift for her daughter, because she wants to instill in her a taste for high art, and such things in the mass market do not have their own history and lack individuality.</p></div><p class="article__text">Then - Hypothesis statement:.</p><div class="article__box"><p class="article__text" style="font-weight: 500;">the sculpture workshop web store will be able to help people find acceptable art objects for people with the need to buy authentic things as a gift, for themselves or for commercial purposes</p></div><p class="article__text">Next, I conducted an analysis of competitors: direct and indirect. Several workshops with their own shops were direct here. Indirect were the mass market through which such goods are sold by individual sellers. Direct competitors had a common disadvantage – it was the lack of a clear identity and positioning, and the design was common to everyone and did not stand out from the mass of user-familiar store interfaces. Mass markets had a plus in the availability of product reviews.</p><p class="article__text">After that, I was already dreaming of a hot bath and sleep, so I made a few sketches of the homepage hero section so that at tomorrow's meeting we would have a basis for defining a common UI design concept (in addition to references).</p><picture class="article__image"><source srcset="img/works/work-08/01-large.png" media="(min-width: 760px)" alt="hero mockups"><img src="img/works/work-08/01-small.png" style="width:100%" alt="hero mockups"></picture><h3 class="article__subtitle">Meeting, brief and brainstorming</h3><p class="article__text">The next day I was already sitting in a coffee shop with a prepared brief and a couple of layouts. There were two men and a girl in front of me: they were really great. The guys told me about their project, about how they want to expand their business and create more products for sale.</p><p class="article__text">God, it was so nice to meet the customer offline! Because of the pandemic, such things have become more valuable.) We immersed ourselves in my research and came to a common vision of the future product.</p><p class="article__text">I sketched a possible userflow and sitemap. I wanted to find out in as much detail as possible how they see the site in order to avoid unnecessary refines in the future. From my experience, I can definitely say that if the client has his own vision of the project (and it was that case), it is better to highlight it from the very beginning and work out the main issues that arise.</p><p class="article__text"> It was also important for me to find out the client's usual path for their company: how is the order being made now? What happens after? All stages from the order to the receipt of the goods by the customer.</p><picture class="article__image"><source srcset="img/works/work-08/sketching-large.png" media="(min-width: 760px)" alt="sketching and coffee"><img src="img/works/work-08/sketching-small.png" style="width:100%" alt="sketching and coffee"></picture><strong class="article__text" style="font-weight: 500;">During our brainstorming I defined next pages,elements and styles with client's preferences:</strong><ul class="article__list"><li class="article__item">HOMEPAGE: welcome + intro with a few goods and cta button 'view full catalog' + box with a little info about brand with btn 'learn more about us'</li><li class="article__item">CATALOG: 5 sections for now - busts, statuettes, pictures, custom orders and moldings</li><li class="article__item">CATALOG SECTION: product list with a product card as a popup</li><li class="article__item">ABOUT PAGE</li><li class="article__item">FAQ PAGE</li><li class="article__item">HEADER: burger always (in all versions)</li><li class="article__item">FOOTER: cta subscribing, socials, logo and contacts</li><li class="article__item">MENU: catalog and its section make as submenu</li><li class="article__item">UI: dark and golden colors, sans serif for functional elements and serif for others</li></ul><p class="article__text">Next, I needed to understand the situation with the content: it was necessary to create a shoot for the studio team and products for the catalog. Usually, I do it myself, but this time the customer already had a team with a photographer and illustrators and they came under my control for the duration of the project. An unexpected pleasant bonus.</p><p class="article__text">The meeting was as productive and informative as possible. All the upcoming tasks were clear to me and I couldn't wait to start developing prototypes.</p><h3 class="article__subtitle">Design development and 61 versions of the homepage</h3><p class="article__text">I looked through all the data from the meeting and the first task for me was to create a lo-fi prototype of the mobile version. Since the main elements were already defined, it was not difficult for me to quickly cope with the task. During this step of creating the main functionality of the product, it is important for me to make adjustments to the psychology of user behavior. Usually, I imagine myself in their place and walk all the path, as if I see the product for the first time. It helps me to identify shortcomings and make the right decisions. </p><p class="article__text">After finishing, I sent a prototype to customers for testing: I created the main flow of pages + several solutions to such problems as the catalog view, a slider with a photo in the product card and navigation. After the customer tested the prototype and made decisions about all the points, I created a responsive desktop version on this basis and also sent it to the test.</p><h4 class="article__subtitling">Client changes the product course</h4><p class="article__text">Initially, the task was to build a standard–looking store with the usual flow of ordering: product-> adding to cart-> payment-> delivery. The customers changed their direction and set a new task. Let me explain: their studio works with personal clients who visit the workshop, order individual products and make payment upon the fact. Now they are not ready to implement a standard store yet and asked me to remove this functionality and offer another solution that will be more comfortable and familiar for them now.</p><p class="article__text">I thought about the situation: customers still planned to launch a large-scale store, but in the process of scaling next year, so it should be easy for them to move from the current design point to the necessary one. Therefore, I decided to simply change the order path starting from the product card: replace the "add to cart" button with "order goods via telegram" with an explanatory text for the user. And also on the FAQ page, put a step-by-step guide to obtaining a workshop service with all the necessary information.</p><p class="article__text">I have made changes and added a stock photo now so that the client understands the flow better. Next, I tested the prototype and received approval of the result.</p><picture class="article__image"><source srcset="img/works/work-08/lofi-large.png" media="(min-width: 760px)" alt="low-fidelity prototype wireframes"><img src="img/works/work-08/lofi-small.png" style="width:100%" alt="low-fidelity prototype wireframes"></picture><p class="article__text">Now all the elements were in their places and it was time to breathe life into them with the help of the UI. Before that, I made a list of photos and text content that would be needed and set these tasks to the team: they set the shooting date and the necessary preparations. This was done so that all the content would be ready when I finish hi-fi and start in the development.</p><h4 class="article__subtitling">Going forward: UI</h4><p class="article__text">So, UI time. As the daughter of artists, I was taught to do the following:</p><div class="article__box"><p class="article__text">I lie down, close my eyes and imagine everything there is for this project. All the information, pictures, everything I know about art, busts, sculptures, their manufacture. </p><p class="article__text" style="font-weight: 500;">I am a user now - what associations I have with the object?</p><p class="article__text">As a result, the main composition is born and I start the creative process in reality. The design research: formstorming, style boards, creatives, testing solutions.</p></div><picture class="article__image" style="margin-top:3rem;"><source srcset="img/works/work-08/meditation.svg" media="(min-width: 760px)" alt="author is meditating"><img src="img/works/work-08/meditation.svg" style="width:100%" alt="author is meditating"></picture><p class="article__text">Since I already had the requirements for colors and fonts set in the brief, and since I was already able to determine the design style, I created the main designs.</p><p class="article__text">And then – a little adventure.)</p><p class="article__text">At this stage, I have created 61 variants of the layout of the main page, but we have not come to the final result.</p><picture class="article__image"><source srcset="img/works/work-08/hero-large.png" media="(min-width: 760px)" alt="many design mockups"><img src="img/works/work-08/hero-small.png" style="width:100%" alt="many design mockups"></picture><p class="article__text">I want to explain: when a task is delayed best way is to have a visual meeting - offline or in zoom where all team can visualize solutions and come to the right decisions. We had an opportunity to meet offline so...</p><p class="article__text">We ordered coffee ☕ and toast and didn't notice how 3 hours flew by – I took my laptop with me and could immediately visually show the location of the elements and change the style variables. At the end of the meeting, all the issues were resolved, now the design has become completely different and I started building the site.</p><div class="article__box"><strong class="article__text" style="font-weight: 500;">a little reflection:</strong><p class="article__text">I think the main hitches in the development process are due to the difference in the vision of even a simple object, which is why it is important to show everything and not just tell. Also, visual representation works differently for people. For example, it's easy for me to imagine what any object in space will look like, even if it's not there, but there are people who find it difficult to do this and therefore need to help them see different possible design options and find what they like. 💗</p></div><a class="article__text" href="https://www.figma.com/proto/YyJEKJZeYi0FrfJy2V57G1/website-for-a-stylist?page-id=322%3A1251&amp;node-id=321%3A4&amp;viewport=471%2C385%2C0.09&amp;scaling=min-zoom&amp;starting-point-node-id=321%3A4" style="font-weight: 500; text-decoration: underline; color: black; margin:2rem 0;">Watch prototype in Figma</a><picture class="article__image"><source srcset="img/works/work-08/hifi-00-large.png" media="(min-width: 760px)" alt="high-fidelity prototype mockups"><img src="img/works/work-08/hifi-00-small.png" style="width:100%" alt="high-fidelity prototype mockups"></picture><h3 class="article__subtitle">Build, test and launch</h3><p class="article__text">I made up the site in the builder (the usual choice of customers), because they wanted to manage it independently later without involving regular developers.</p><p class="article__text">At this stage, the main task for me was high-quality layout, taking into account seo recommendations.
